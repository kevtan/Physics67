# Final projects

The goals of the final projects are:

	1. To give you an opportunity to follow up on a topic that we covered that interested you.
	   That could be either some methodology, or a scientific topic.

	2. To give you a chance to apply some of the things we learned in this course.

The idea is for your group to work as independently or with as much guidance
as you prefer.

If your group  prefers to work independetly,  great, each project notebook has some suggestions of things you might do, and
some tools to get you started.

If your group prefers to have some guidance from the instructiors,
great, we are available to help.

We have designed five different projects.  The idea is that you will work in small groups, as usual, on the projects.
We are expecting you to spend about three hours on the project.
Try and get all of the analysis that you need to do done in class.  Then spend another hour and a half
putting together 3 or 4 simple slides and a half page of write-up describing what you did.

We have posted examples of [slides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10S9qiCLn2xp8Wg3LyjUd0w6JLZew30ZwEcc3emNfw9Q/edit?usp=sharing) and of the [write up](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ueCFssD_V3Nl9JXZN-YCIh2uc18UMgXUK5NizApxk_s/edit?usp=sharing).

Here are the 5 potential projects for you to choose from.  Also, if there is another topic that particularly interests you, you should feel free to
propose your own project, keeping in mind that you should expect to spend about 3 hours on the project.

The projects will be due on the Friday, June 3rd.   We will use the final tuesday as an in-person office hours to allow you to work on the project or making up labs that you might have missed.

I will also have a number of zoom office hour slots for you to sign up for over that last week, for the same purpose.

### 1. Quantifying the "Hubble Tension"

[Notebook](Project_Hubble_Tension.ipynb)

In the first couple weeks of the class we saw that the measurements or the Hubble parameters weren't really distributed as a Gaussian.

This project will look more into that question, and in particular you will separate measurements done with two different types of techniques and
ask if the two techniques seem to be giving constant results.

This project requires very little in the way or programing skills or math skills, but will require you to apply concepts from this course to
quantify the significance of your results.

### 2. A deeper dive in model fitting.

[Notebook](Project_Fitting_Deep_Dive.ipynb)

In this project you will go back to the Vela puslar data, and you will study the process of fitting the model parameters in more detail.
This will help you to understand relationships between some of the statistics that we studied in this course.

This project doesn't require much programming, but will require more math, and you will be taking a very close look at the concepts of chi-squared,
and using inverse variance weighting to combine measurements.


### 3. Writing an algorithm to derive initial guesses for model parameters when fitting SDSS spectral lines.

[Notebook](Project_SDSS_Line_Fit_Algo.ipynb)

In week 6 we did a notebook where we fit spectral lines from SDSS data.  In the notebook we guessed initial values for the fit parameters by hand.
The last question in the notebook asked you to suggest and algorithm to estimate the initial values.  This project follows up on that, giving you a
chance to implement your ideas.

This project requires some programming, but is more practical and doesn't require you to use the concept we learned in the course as much as some of
the other projects.


### 4. A "Higgs search".  Searching for a signal peak on top of background. 

[Notebook](Project_Higgs_Search.ipynb)

This project is similar to the work you did in week 7, except that instead of looking for a few rare events, you will be fitting for a small excess
signal on top of a large background.  Also, in this case, the signal peak is defined as events that lie close to a particular value (i.e., the mass
of the Higgs particle), while the background is randomly distributed across a large band.

This project will some programing, though not as much as project 3.  It will also require to apply concepts from the course to quantify the significance
of your result.


### 5. An expolant search.  Searching for a signal in the frequency domain. 

[Notebook](Project_Exoplanet.ipynb)

This project is similar to the stuff we will be doing in week 8.  Except that you will be trying to extract a signal from an idealized version of
data that you might obtain when looking for exoplanets.

This project will some programing, though not as much as project 3.  It will also require to apply concepts from the course to quantify the significance
of your result.
