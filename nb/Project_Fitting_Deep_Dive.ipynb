    "# Project, a deeper dive into the math behind fitting model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in weeks 5 and 6 we explored fitting model parameters, and in particular, fitting data on the excess counts from Vela using a model with two parameters, a slope and an offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It this project we are going to explore the math behind the fitting a bit more.  In particular we are going to simplify the model a bit by removing the slope, so that we are only fitting for the offset.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This model is simple enough that we can take the derivatives by hand, and we can solve for the minimum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things you might do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the $\\chi^2$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{n_i - m_i(x)}{\\sigma_i})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n_i$ is the number of counts from week $i$ (i.e., 'excess_counts' in the next cell) and $\\sigma_i$ is uncertainty on that number (i.e., 'sigma_counts' in the next cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "And in our case our model is trivial:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m(x) = p_0$, leaving use with\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{n_i - p_0}{\\sigma_i})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some goals for this project could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the first and second partial derivativs of the $\\chi^2$ with respect to $p_0$.   If you aren't sure how to take a derivative of an expression inside a sum you can try just writing out the first three terms of the sum and taking the derivatives of those:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 = (\\frac{n_0 - p_0}{\\sigma_i})^2 + (\\frac{n_i - p_0}{\\sigma_i})^2 + (\\frac{n_2 - p_0}{\\sigma_i})^2 + ...$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write out your own expression of the first and second derivatives of $\\chi^2$ with respect to $p_0$.  Implement them as functions, plot them and verify your results by comparing them to the functions that we wrote that date the derivatives numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then you can explicitly solve for best fit value of $p_0$ by solving for the place where the first derivative is zero.  This will give you an expressing for $p_0$ in terms of the $n_i$ and $\\sigma_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can explicitly solve for uncertainty on $p_0$ ($\\sigma_{p0}$) by noting that they correspond to the points where the $\\chi^2$ function changes by 1 with respect to the minimum, and also by noting that the $\\chi^2$ function is a parabola, you can also write as $\\Delta \\chi^2 = a (\\delta p_0)^2$.  (For this step you can either demonstrate that for our case $a = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2\\chi^2}{\\partial p_0^2}$ or you can just take our word on that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, you can compare the formulas you got for $p_0$ and $\\sigma_{p0}$ to the formulas for taking the weighted average by inverse variance weighting. \n"
