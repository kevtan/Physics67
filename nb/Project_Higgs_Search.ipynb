    "# Searching for the Higgs boson\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in weeks 7 of this course we searched for dark matter in a simplified data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we are going to seach for the Higgs Boson.  In spirit this is similar to the dark matter search,\n",
    "but there are going to be a few differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The detectors are quite different.  The detectors at CERN that were used to discover the Higgs particle are massive, basically the size of a 6 story building (about 150 long and 75 feet tall).  The detectors capture information from many particles that are produced when two protons collide at very nearly the speed of light.  Complicated data analysis algorithms then filter that data to find events that might have contained a Higgs particle.  The last step of the analysis is to combined together the particles that were flagged as possibly resulting from the Higgs particle's decay, as seeing if they are consistent with the mass of the Higgs particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the dark matter search in week 7, we used the log(s2) (i.e., the log of the electron charge signal) to distinguish signal from background.  For the Higgs search we as going to be using using the mass computed from combined different sets of particles collected in the detector.  For background events that mass will be randomly distributed, and we will model it as a linear function.  For signal events that mass will be centered of the mass of the Higgs particle ( $m_{H} = 125.1 \\frac{\\rm GeV}{c^2}$ ).   This means that in the Higgs search, we will be cutting on both sides of the signal.   I.e., the signal events are $ | m - m_{H} | < w $, where $w$ is the width of the cut window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In this search, we have much more data, even at the last step of the data analysis.  Both the rate of signal events and background events is much higher that it was for the dark matter search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try two different ways of doing the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Cut and count\".  Basically you define a signal region and background region and show that there are more events in the signal region that in the background region.  In our case, since the background is not constant, it make sense to pick two background regions, one on either side of the signal, and to average them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/higgs_cut_and_count_2.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Fitting\".  In this case you make signal and background models and use a fit optimizer to extract the size of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Higgs_Mass_fit.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
